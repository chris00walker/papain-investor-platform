| **Hypothesis** | Regional papain processors have unmet demand of 800+ tons annually and will pay $15-20/kg for reliable local supply |
| **Success Threshold** | 3+ processors commit to 200+ tons annually at $15+/kg |
| **Experiment** | Customer Discovery Interviews with 10 processors |

#### Papaya Yield in Barbados Conditions

| **Experiment** | Pilot Plot Trial (1-hectare test plot) |

#### Premium Pricing Acceptance

| Element | Details |
|---------|----------|
| **Hypothesis** | Customers will pay 15-20% premium for locally-grown, certified papaya products |
